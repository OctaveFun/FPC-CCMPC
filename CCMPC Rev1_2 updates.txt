Updates to REV1_2

added free-running marker which follows the mouse pointer. Time is updated as marker moves across the graph. All values for this particular time instance are also updated and displayed. 
Also added a "Schleifen", trail left on the screen from dragging marker with left mouse button pressed. This gives a better visual representation of an area being zoomed in to.
